            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
            efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
            approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
            dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
            ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
            many areas on most platforms.
          </p>
          <p>Two great things about Python:</p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
              Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be
              reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection
              of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs
              — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of
              these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets,
              and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable
              time during program development because no compilation and linking
              is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which
              makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to
              write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up
              program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably.
            Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than
            equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
          </p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
              The high-level data types allow you to express complex operations
              in a single statement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and
              ending brackets.
            </li>
            <li>No variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>

            Installing Python is generally easy, and nowadays many Linux and
            UNIX distributions include a recent Python. Even some Windows
            computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already
            installed.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do need to install Python and aren't confident about the task
            you can find a few notes on the

            wiki page, but installation is unremarkable on most platforms.
          </p>

            The Python interpreter is usually installed as
            <span class="command-text">/usr/local/bin/python3.11</span> on those
            machines where it is available; putting
            <span class="command-text">/usr/local/bin</span> in your Unix
            shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the
            command:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box">python3.11</code>
          <p>
            to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the
            interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are
            possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator.
            (E.g., <span class="command-text">/usr/local/python</span> is a
            popular alternative location.)
          </p>
          <p>
            On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the
            Microsoft Store, the
            <span class="command-text">python3.11</span> command will be
            available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use
            the <span class="command-text">py</span> command.

            Open the terminal in your operating system (as discussed previously
            in the Installation chapter) and then open the Python prompt by
            typing python3 and pressing [enter] key. Once you have started
            Python, you should see >>> where you can start typing stuff. This is
            called the Python interpreter prompt. At the Python interpreter
            prompt, type:
          </p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >print("Hello World")

            <span class="italic" style="font-family: monospace"
              >>>> Hello World</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            followed by the [enter] key. You should see the words Hello World
            printed to the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that Python gives you the output of the line immediately!
            What you just entered is a single Python statement. We use print to
            (unsurprisingly) <span class="command-text">print</span> any value
            that you supply to it. Here, we are supplying the text
            <span class="command-text">Hello World</span> and this is promptly
            printed to the screen.

            Before getting fully started, you may want to find out which IDEs
            and text editors are tailored to make Python editing easy, browse
            the list of introductory books, or look at code samples that you
            might find helpful. We cannot type out our program at the
            interpreter prompt every time we want to run something, so we have
            to save them in files and can run our programs any number of times.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create our Python source files, we need an editor software where
            you can type and save. A good programmer's editor will make your
            life easier in writing the source files. Hence, the choice of an
            editor is crucial indeed. You have to choose an editor as you would
            choose a car you would buy. A good editor will help you write Python
            programs easily, making your journey more comfortable and helps you
            reach your destination (achieve your goal) in a much faster and
            safer way.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have no idea where to start, you could start with
            <span class="bold">PyCharm Educational Edition</span> software which
            is available on Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are an experienced programmer, then you must be already using
            <span class="bold">Vim</span> or <span class="bold">Emacs</span>.
            Needless to say, these are two of the most powerful editors and you
            will benefit from using them to write your Python programs.

            Variables are containers for storing data values.<br />They are
            examples of identifiers. Identifiers are names given to identify
            something. There are some rules you have to follow for naming
            identifiers:
          </p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>
              The first character of the identifier must be a letter of the
              alphabet (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character)
              or an underscore (<span class="command-text">_</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
              The rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (uppercase
              ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character), underscores (<span
                class="command-text"
                >_</span
              >) or digits (0-9).
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifier names are case-sensitive. For example,
              <span class="command-text">myname</span> and
              <span class="command-text">myName</span> are not the same. Note
              the lowercase <span class="command-text">n</span> in the former
              and the uppercase <span class="command-text">N</span> in the
              latter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Examples of <span class="italic">valid</span> identifier names are
              <span class="command-text">i</span>,
              <span class="command-text">name_2_3</span>. Examples of
              <span class="italic">invalid</span> identifier names are
              <span class="command-text">2things</span>,
              <span class="command-text">this is spaced out</span>,
              <span class="command-text">my-name</span> and
              <span class="command-text">>a1b2_c3</span>.

            An example of a literal constant is a number like
            <span class="command-text">5</span>,
            <span class="command-text">1.23</span>, or a string like
            <span class="command-text">'This is a string'</span> or
            <span class="command-text">"It's a string!"</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is called a literal because it is
            <span class="italic">literal</span> - you use its value literally.
            The number 2 always represents itself and nothing else - it is a
            constant because its value cannot be changed. Hence, all these are
            referred to as literal constants.

          <p>
            Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the
            examples above) are known as global variables. Global variables can
            be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this
            variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function.
            The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global
            and with the original value.

          <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>

            <li>Greater than: <span class="command-text">a > b</span></li>
            <li>
              Greater than or equal to: <span class="command-text">a >= b</span>

          </ul>
          <p>
            The <span class="command-text">if</span> statement is used to check
            a condition: <span class="italic">if</span> the condition is true,
            we run a block of statements (called the
            <span class="italic">if-block</span>),
            <span class="command-text">else</span> we process another block of
            statements (called the <span class="italic">else-block</span>). The
            <span class="italic">else</span> clause is optional.
          </p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))

            changed to zero') elif x == 0: &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print('Zero') elif

          <p>
            There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.
            The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid
            excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a
            substitute for the switch or case statements found in other
            languages.

            A <span class="command-text">for</span> loop is used for iterating
            over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a
            set, or a string).
          </p>
          <p>
            This is less like the <span class="command-text">for</span> keyword
            in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator
            method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
            Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a
            list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the <span class="command-text">for</span> loop we can execute a
            set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set, etc.
          </p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] for x in fruits:
            &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print(x)

            <span class="italic" style="font-family: monospace"
              >>>> apple >>> banana >>> cherry</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            As you can see, this first example is a for statement that reads the
            values inside the list and prints them as strings.
          </p>
          <p>Or a bit more complex example:</p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] for w in words:
            &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print(w, len(w))

            <span class="italic" style="font-family: monospace"
              >>>> cat 3 >>> window 6 >>> defenestrate 12</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            This second one is a for statement which goes through the elements
            of the list, and prints out them and the length of each word, in
            this case, the amount of letters.

          <p>
            The <span class="command-text">while</span> statement allows you to
            repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is
            true.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an example of what is called a

            optional <span class="command-text">else</span> clause.

            &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;# Do anything else you want to do here
            print('Done')
          </code>
          <p>
            We move the <span class="command-text">input</span> and
            <span class="command-text">if</span> statements to inside the
            <span class="command-text">while</span> loop and set the variable
            <span class="command-text">running</span> to
            <span class="command-text">True</span> before the while loop. First,
            we check if the variable <span class="italic">running</span> is
            <span class="italic">True</span> and then proceed to execute the
            corresponding <span class="italic">while-block</span>. After this
            block is executed, the condition is again checked which in this case
            is the <span class="italic">running</span> variable. If it is true,
            we execute the while-block again, else we continue to execute the
            optional else-block and then continue to the next statement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="command-text">else</span> block is executed when
            the <span class="command-text">while</span> loop condition becomes
            <span class="command-text">False</span> - this may even be the first
            time that the condition is checked. If there is an
            <span class="italic">else</span> clause for a
            <span class="italic">while</span> loop, it is always executed unless
            you break out of the loop with a
            <span class="command-text">break</span> statement.

          <p>
            Functions are reusable pieces of programs. They allow you to give a
            name to a block of statements, allowing you to run that block using
            the specified name anywhere in your program and any number of times.
            This is known as calling the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Functions are defined using the
            <span class="command-text">def</span> keyword. After this keyword
            comes an <span class="italic">identifier</span> name for the
            function, followed by a pair of parentheses which may enclose some
            names of variables, and by the final colon that ends the line. Next
            follows the block of statements that are part of this function.
          </p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >def say_hello(): &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;# block belonging to the
            function &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print('hello world') # End of function
            say_hello() # call the function say_hello() # call the function
            again

            <span class="italic" style="font-family: monospace"
              >>>> hello world >>> hello world</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            We define a function called
            <span class="command-text">say_hello</span> using the syntax as
            explained above. This function takes no parameters and hence there
            are no variables declared in the parentheses. Parameters to
            functions are just input to the function so that we can pass in
            different values to it and get back corresponding results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice that we can call the same function twice which means we do
            not have to write the same code again.

        <article class="article-style">
          <p>
            A function can take parameters, which are values you supply to the
            function so that the function can do something utilising those
            values. These parameters are just like variables except that the
            values of these variables are defined when we call the function and
            are already assigned values when the function runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parameters are specified within the pair of parentheses in the
            function definition, separated by commas. When we call the function,
            we supply the values in the same way. Note the terminology used -
            the names given in the function definition are called parameters
            whereas the values you supply in the function call are called
            arguments.
          </p>
          <code class="code-box"
            >def print_max(a, b): &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;if a > b:
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print(a, 'is maximum')
            &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;elif a == b:
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print(a, 'is equal to', b)
            &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;else: &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;print(b, 'is
            maximum') # directly pass literal values print_max(3, 4) x = 5 y = 7
            # pass variables as arguments print_max(x, y)

            <span class="italic" style="font-family: monospace"
              >>>> 4 is maximum >>> 7 is maximum</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            Here, we define a function called
            <span class="command-text">print_max</span> that uses two parameters
            called <span class="command-text">a</span> and
            <span class="command-text">b</span>. We find out the greater number
            using a simple <span class="command-text">if..else</span> statement
            and then print the bigger number.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first time we call the function
            <span class="command-text">print_max</span>, we directly supply the
            numbers as arguments. In the second case, we call the function with
            variables as arguments.
            <span class="command-text">print_max(x, y)</span> causes the value
            of argument <span class="command-text">x</span> to be assigned to
            parameter <span class="command-text">a</span> and the value of
            argument <span class="command-text">y</span> to be assigned to
            parameter <span class="command-text">b</span>. The
            <span class="italic">print_max</span> function works the same way in
            both cases.
